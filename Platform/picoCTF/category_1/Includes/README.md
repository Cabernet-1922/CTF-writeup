> <p>Can you get the flag?</p>

By viewing the source code of the page, we can see `script.js` and `style.css`. Try to access them and we can see half part of the flag is located in each of the file. Concatenate them together will give us the flag.


flag: 'picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}'
