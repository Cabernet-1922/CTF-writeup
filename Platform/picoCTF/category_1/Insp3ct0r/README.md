View the source code of the website, we can find that there is a comment about the first part of flag: `picoCTF{tru3_d3`.
Then check `/mycss.css` and `/myjs.js` respectively to get the second part and third part of the flag: `t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t` and `_lucky?2e7b23e3}`


flag: `picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?2e7b23e3}`
